Hi,

this is a small library which can handle a rotary encoder with button.
In the moment the only tested and supported encoder is the CESI-32/LX from http://www.ebe-gmbh.de/cont/de/ebe/pro/itro/CESI.html 

The main features are:
	- button is debounced 
	- internal rotary counter 
	- easy usage by support of callback functions :)

maybe i will make it interrupt driven with some other rotary encoders, but in the moment i build this for controlling an lcd menu with the Arduino.

So i hope the example tells you how to use this library just cope it to the Arduino IDE library path and open the example.

Cheers,
Nils
