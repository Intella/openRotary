/* This is an example of how to use the CESI-32/LX with openRotary libary.
 * I wrote this libary to make it easier to handle the rotary encoder stuff.
 * I am using this rotary encoder in a current projekt for controlling menu, 
 * the CESI-32 is easy to use and industrial improved with 2 x10^6 rotations.
 * 
 * here is some info about the rotary encoder:
 * CESI-32/LX (CESI L: 5 Vâ€“ /10 mA) http://www.ebe-gmbh.de/cont/de/ebe/pro/itro/CESI.html 
 * datasheet http://www.ebe-gmbh.de/load/ebe/i-tronic/de/ebe_i-tro_de_CSI.pdf
 * 
 * CESI-32 Pin  function        Arduino Micro
 *          1      5V             5V-Pin
 *          2      GND            GND-Pin
 *          4      direction      A3                         
 *          5      rotation       A3
 *          7      button1        5V
 *          8      button2        A4 (pulled with 4k7 down)
 * 
 * so have fun with it :)
